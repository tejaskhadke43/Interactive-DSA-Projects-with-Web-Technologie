🧠 Interactive DSA Projects with Web Technologies
Welcome to my collection of Interactive Data Structures and Algorithms Projects built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS!
This repository showcases real-world applications of core DSA concepts brought to life through intuitive, browser-based user interfaces.

📘 What You'll Learn (For Enthusiastic Learners)
Visual and Practical Understanding of DSA: Explore how core algorithms like sorting, searching, graph traversal, and memory management apply to real-world systems.
Interactive Interfaces: Engage with simulations like AVL Tree for stock prices, Red-Black Trees for leaderboards, and Heaps for event ranking systems.
Project-based Learning: Learn DSA not just theoretically, but through building and using web applications that model real-world problems.

👨‍💼 What I Offer
Developed 40+ interactive DSA projects entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – no frameworks.
Designed each project to map DSA to real-life systems like file systems, ticket booking, ATM queues, music streaming, and more.
Demonstrated not just coding ability, but also system thinking, UI/UX design, and problem-solving.

🚀 Technologies Used
Languages: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
No External Libraries – Pure logic, DOM manipulation, and styling
